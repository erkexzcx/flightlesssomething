# Memory optimization settings (optional)
# GOGC controls garbage collection frequency (default: 100, lower = more frequent GC, less memory)
# For systems with limited RAM, set to 50-75 for aggressive GC
# GOGC=50

# GOMEMLIMIT sets a soft memory limit for the Go runtime (e.g., "512MiB", "1GiB", "2GiB")
# Go 1.19+ will try to keep memory usage below this limit
# Supported units: KiB, MiB, GiB, TiB
# GOMEMLIMIT=512MiB
