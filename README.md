# FlightlessSomething

[flightlessmango.com](https://flightlessmango.com/) website clone, written in Go.

Ever wanted to say _holy crap, who wrote this shit?_ - well, now you can. This project is written not by web developer (or developer at all), so likelly full of vulnerabilities. ðŸ¤·

# Features

* Written in Go:
  * Fast performance
  * Multithreaded
  * Single, statically linked binary
* Uses `gin` web framework
* Uses `gorm` ORM (Can be easily ported to other databases)

## Features that will NOT be included

* TLS/SSL/ACME - use reverse proxy (I suggest [Caddy](https://github.com/caddyserver/caddy))

# Pull requests

Pull requests are _more_ than welcome, especially fixing vulnerabilities.
