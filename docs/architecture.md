# Architecture

FlightlessSomething is designed to run on low-resource servers — constrained RAM and CPU — while handling large benchmark datasets (up to 1 million data points per benchmark). Every architectural decision prioritizes memory efficiency over raw throughput.

## System Overview

The application compiles into a **single Go binary** with the Vue.js frontend embedded via Go's `//go:embed` directive. At runtime, the binary serves both the REST API and the single-page application from the same HTTP port (default `:5000`). There are no external runtime dependencies beyond a filesystem for SQLite and benchmark data files.

## Backend

### Technology Stack

| Component | Choice | Rationale |
|-----------|--------|-----------|
| Language | Go | Low memory footprint, single binary output, built-in concurrency |
| HTTP framework | [Gin](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin) | Lightweight, fast routing |
| ORM | [GORM](https://gorm.io/) with SQLite | Zero-configuration embedded database, no external process |
| Compression | [zstd](https://github.com/klauspost/compress) | High compression ratio with fast decompression |
| Serialization | Go's `encoding/gob` | Compact binary format, native to Go |
| Configuration | CLI flags + env vars (`FS_` prefix) via [ff](https://github.com/peterbourgon/ff) | Flexible deployment |

### Request Lifecycle

Every API handler follows a consistent pattern:

1. **Validate input** — check required fields, length limits, numeric bounds
2. **Check authentication/authorization** — session or Bearer token, admin flag
3. **Execute operation** — database query, file I/O, or both
4. **Audit log** — record the action to file-based JSON log (non-blocking; failures are logged to stdout but don't fail the request)
5. **Return JSON response**

### Pagination

All list endpoints use offset-based pagination:

- `page` (default 1) + `per_page` (default varies by endpoint, max 100)
- Responses include `total`, `page`, `per_page`, and `total_pages`

### Search

Multi-field `LIKE` queries with a minimum 3-character search term. Benchmark search covers title, description, run names, and hardware specifications. User search covers username and Discord ID.

### Rate Limiting

An in-memory sliding window rate limiter protects write operations:

- **Benchmark uploads**: 5 per 10 minutes per user (non-admins)
- **Admin login**: 3 failed attempts per 10 minutes (global lock)

A background goroutine cleans up expired entries every 5 minutes. The implementation uses `sync.RWMutex` for thread safety.

### MCP Protocol

The application exposes a [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) (MCP) endpoint at `/mcp` using JSON-RPC 2.0. This allows AI assistants to interact with the application programmatically. Tools mirror the REST API, except for binary file transfer operations (upload/download) which are unsuitable for MCP.

## Frontend

### Technology Stack

| Component | Choice | Rationale |
|-----------|--------|-----------|
| Framework | Vue 3 (Composition API) | Reactive UI with `<script setup>` syntax |
| State | [Pinia](https://pinia.vuejs.org/) | Lightweight state management |
| Routing | Vue Router | Client-side navigation with lazy loading |
| Build | [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) | Fast development builds, optimized production output |
| Charts | [Highcharts](https://www.highcharts.com/) | Interactive benchmark visualization |
| Styling | Bootstrap 5 + Font Awesome | No custom CSS framework |
| Security | [DOMPurify](https://github.com/cure53/DOMPurify) + [Marked](https://marked.js.org/) | Safe Markdown rendering in descriptions |

### Chunk Splitting

Vite is configured with manual chunk splitting to optimize loading:

- **`vendor`** chunk — Vue, Vue Router, Pinia (framework code, cached long-term)
- **`charts`** chunk — Highcharts (large library, loaded only when viewing benchmarks)

### Web Workers

CPU-intensive operations run in Web Workers to keep the UI responsive:

- **`jsonParser.worker.js`** — parses large JSON responses in a background thread, preventing the main thread from freezing on benchmarks with hundreds of thousands of data points
- **`statsCalculator.worker.js`** — calculates statistics (percentiles, min/max, averages, standard deviation) in parallel, supporting both linear-interpolation and MangoHud-threshold calculation methods

### Incremental Data Loading

Benchmark data is fetched one run at a time via `/api/benchmarks/:id/runs/:runIndex`. Each run is processed immediately — downsampled and statistics calculated — then raw data is discarded. This prevents Vue's reactivity system from tracking massive arrays, keeping memory usage proportional to the downsampled display data rather than the full dataset.

### API Client

All API calls go through a centralized client (`web/src/api/client.js`) that provides:

- Structured error handling via an `APIError` class
- Progress callbacks for download and parse operations
- Dynamic imports for benchmark data loaders (reducing initial bundle size)

### SPA Routing

The embedded SPA uses fallback routing:

- `/assets/*` and `/favicon.*` — static files from the embedded filesystem
- `/api/*`, `/auth/*`, `/health`, `/mcp` — API routes
- Everything else — serves `index.html` for Vue Router to handle client-side

## Performance Design

This application is built to run on servers with as little as 512 MiB of RAM. The following techniques keep memory usage low while processing large datasets.

### Garbage Collection Tuning

The application sets `GOGC=50` at startup (default Go value is 100), which triggers garbage collection twice as frequently. This trades a small amount of CPU time for significantly lower peak memory usage. Operators can further tune with:

- `GOGC` — garbage collection target percentage
- `GOMEMLIMIT` — soft memory limit (e.g. `512MiB`), leveraging Go's memory-limit-aware GC

### Two-Pass CSV Parsing

When a user uploads a benchmark CSV file, it is parsed in two passes:

1. **First pass** — stream through the file counting lines, storing nothing in memory
2. **Second pass** — reopen the file and parse with exact-capacity pre-allocated slices

This eliminates slice growth and reallocation. Each of the 13 metric arrays (`DataFPS`, `DataFrameTime`, `DataCPULoad`, etc.) is pre-allocated to the exact line count.

### Streaming Data Storage (V2 Format)

Benchmark data is stored as zstd-compressed gob with a per-run encoding scheme:

```
.bin file:
  [zstd compression]
    ├── fileHeader { Version: 2, RunCount: N }
    ├── BenchmarkData (run 1)  ← individually gob-encoded
    ├── BenchmarkData (run 2)
    └── ...
```

This enables **streaming reads** — the server decodes and writes one run at a time, without loading the entire benchmark into memory. During streaming:

- **JSON export** (`StreamBenchmarkDataAsJSON`) triggers `runtime.GC()` every 10 runs
- **ZIP export** (`ExportBenchmarkDataAsZip`) triggers `runtime.GC()` every 5 runs

The companion `.meta` file stores run count and labels as gob, enabling quick metadata access without decompressing the data file.

### Compression

zstd compression is configured with:

- **Encoder**: `SpeedDefault` level, 2 concurrent threads, 256 KB write buffer
- **Decoder**: 2 concurrent threads

This balances compression ratio, speed, and memory usage. Limiting concurrency to 2 threads avoids overwhelming low-CPU servers.

### Data Limits

Hard limits prevent any single upload from consuming excessive resources:

| Limit | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Total data lines per benchmark | 1,000,000 |
| Data lines per single run | 500,000 |
| Benchmark title | 100 characters |
| Benchmark description | 5,000 characters |
| API tokens per user | 10 |

## Data Storage

### Database

SQLite with GORM auto-migration. The database file (`flightlesssomething.db`) stores user accounts, benchmark metadata, and API tokens. Schema version is tracked in a `schema_versions` table (current version: 5). Audit logs are written to a JSON log file (`{dataDir}/logs/audit.json`) inside the data directory, with automatic rotation (gzip-compressed) at 10 MB and retention of the 10 most recent rotated files.

### Benchmark Files

Benchmark data is stored on the filesystem, not in the database:

```
{dataDir}/benchmarks/
  ├── {id}.bin     zstd-compressed gob (V2 streaming format)
  └── {id}.meta    gob-encoded metadata (run count + labels)
```

Each `.bin` file contains a header followed by individually encoded runs. Each `.meta` file provides quick access to run count and labels without decompressing the data.

### Schema Migrations

Migrations run automatically on startup:

- **v0 → v1**: Removed `ai_summary` column, created `schema_versions` table
- **v1 → v2**: Added `RunNames` and `Specifications` searchable fields to benchmarks
- **v2 → v3**: Migrated storage format from V1 (single array) to V2 (per-run streaming) and regenerated metadata files
- **v3 → v4**: Pre-calculated statistics for all benchmarks (`.stats` files) for instant loading
- **v4 → v5**: Dropped `audit_logs` table (audit logs moved to file-based JSON logging)

Legacy V1 data files are detected by reading the file header. If the header decode fails, the server falls back to legacy loading (full dataset in memory).

## Authentication

Three authentication methods, used in different contexts:

### Discord OAuth 2.0

Primary login for end users:

1. `GET /auth/login` generates a random state token and redirects to Discord
2. Discord callback exchanges the code for a token and fetches user info
3. The server creates or updates the User record and sets a session cookie
4. Ban status is checked before completing login

### Admin Login

System administrator login with username and password:

- `POST /auth/admin/login` with credentials
- Rate limited globally (3 failed attempts per 10 minutes)
- Creates a special user with `DiscordID = "admin"`

### API Token Authentication

For programmatic access (API and MCP):

- `Authorization: Bearer <64-char-hex-token>` header
- The `RequireAuthOrToken` middleware checks session cookies first, then falls back to Bearer tokens
- Tracks `LastUsedAt` on the token and `LastAPIActivityAt` on the user

### Session Security

- HttpOnly cookies (not accessible via JavaScript)
- SameSite=Lax (CSRF protection)
- Secure flag auto-detected from the OAuth redirect URL scheme (HTTPS = secure)
- Cookie store encrypted with the configured session secret

## Build and Deployment

### Build Pipeline

The `Makefile` orchestrates a two-stage build:

1. **`make build-web`** — `npm ci && npm run build` produces `web/dist/`
2. **`make build-server`** — Go compiles with `web/dist/` embedded via `//go:embed`, producing a single binary with version info from git tags

### Docker

A multi-stage Dockerfile minimizes the final image:

1. **Node stage** (node:25-alpine) — builds the Vue.js frontend
2. **Go stage** (go:1.26-alpine) — compiles the server with embedded assets
3. **Runtime stage** (alpine:3.23) — copies only the binary and CA certificates

The final image contains a single binary, CA certificates for HTTPS (Discord OAuth), and nothing else.

### Development

For local development, the backend and frontend run separately:

- **Backend**: `make run` or `go run ./cmd/server` on port 5000
- **Frontend**: `cd web && npm run dev` starts Vite dev server on port 3000, proxying `/api`, `/auth`, and `/health` requests to port 5000
